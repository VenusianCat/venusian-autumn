# Venusian Autumn

Venusian Autumn is a dark, autumnal VS Code theme. I kept the following principles in mind when designing the theme...

* Overall contrast levels will be managed to support a comfortable all-day coding experience.
* Within that framework, the highest contrast area will be the main edit window. Other panels should visually back away to avoid distracting attention.
* The visual salience of code elements is as follows -

1. function calls
2. variables and strings
3. control flow keywords
4. other keywords, html tags and attributes

* Comments should be visually distinct from code elements and easy to read, but not distracting.
* Everything should look harmonious when developing in Svelte. Svelte pages contain JavaScript, HTML and CSS as well as Svelte-specific syntax.
